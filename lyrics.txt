I was taking tips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break

And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!

Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

And now, for some holiday music!
================================
The season's upon us, it's that time of year
Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung
They call this Christmas where I'm from

The table's set, we raise a toast
The father, son, and the Holy Ghost
I'm so glad this day only comes once a year
You can keep your opinions, your presents, your happy new year
They call this Christmas where I'm from
