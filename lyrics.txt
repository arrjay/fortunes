Skip a hit don't make a sound

Voices I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that i'm still breathing.
And I think back to when
My brother of my sister slept
In an unknown place; The only time I feel safe.

Honey it's your son I think I borrowed just too much.
We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle of fun.
And tonight I swear I'll come home, and we'll make love like we're young.
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids;
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes

There is only one thing that I can say
Did you stand by me
No, not at all

Welcome to the inner workings of my mind
So dark and foul I can't disguise, can't disguise
Nights like this I become afraid
Of the darkness in my heart

For guitars and drums and desperate poetry
And I still believe that everyone
Can find a song for every time they've lost
And every time they've won

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking tips of it to my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with the tick-tock rhythm, I bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P-Diddy
Grab my glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city
Before I leave brush mah teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back

Do you dare to speak his name there's evil at the root

Never did believe in saying fortunes are foretold

Written on the sidewalk
Mental mystics in a twisted metal car

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back,
The past is in the past!

I just nod, I've never been so good at shaking hands.
I live on the frozen surface of a fireball
Where cities come together to hate each other in the name of sport.

Had me down
Turn me inside out

And I don't even think you know
